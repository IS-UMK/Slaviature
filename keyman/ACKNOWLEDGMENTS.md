# Acknowledgments

This project incorporates a keyboard layout originally designed by Daniel Lesiński from the Slawiatura project [https://github.com/IS-UMK/Slawiatura]. We would like to thank Daniel Lesiński for his contribution to the development of this project.

We would also like to express our gratitude to Weronika Preinl for providing the idea of developing Slawiatura using the Keyman platform for keyboard creation and sharing. Her inspiration was instrumental in shaping the direction of this project.
