**Slaviature** (pl. *[Slawiatura](pl/README.md)*) is a keyboard layout for the Slavistic Phonetic Alphabet.

Each key can have up to four different characters assigned, arranged
symbolically in the corners of the key:

- Lower left corner — the default character, entered by pressing the key alone.
- Upper left corner — available with `Shift`, usually producing an uppercase
  version of the character shown on the key.
- Lower right corner — available with the right `Alt` key (sometimes labeled as
  AltGr).
- Upper right corner — available with `Shift` and the right `Alt` key.

For example, to type **ä**, press the right `Alt` and `a`. In the documentation,
this is written as `Alt + a`.

To enter a more complex symbol, such as **ã**, first press `a`, then ``Shift + Alt + ` ``
. In the documentation, this is written as ``a, Shift + Alt + ` ``. For an even more
complex symbol **ä̃**  – ``Alt a, Shift + Alt + ` ``. 

The second and third symbols use a diacritic character available on the key with
the ` symbol in the upper-right corner. Slaviature provides eleven diacritic
characters that can be used to compose more complex symbols.
